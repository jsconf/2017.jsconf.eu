"Closing Remarks"

>>  Get in here!  Jan, where are you?  Could we get the lights?  Oh, this is really loud.
    Cool.  We have -- how was the first day of JSConf for you?
    
    [ Applause ]
    
    We have a few things to announce before you all enjoy your dinner.  This also solves the question where Jan was.  Dinner is right now, and after that, we have our Saturday party.  It's over in what was the Side Track during the day.  The doors open at 8:30 and you have to be there by 9:00 both because we have another talk that you don't want to miss.  It's the talk about the opening performance that you all saw this morning when you all woke up right on time.  And it's going to be impressive, and then three DJ sets.  So it should all be covered.  There'll also be livestreaming of the performances into the track.  So if you would like to sit instead of stand with 900 other people, that's fine.
    Do we have anything else to say?  All good?  Oh, yes.  The only thing I wanted to say.  Here -- so we're staying here until nineish but we have to be outside at 9:00 but at 7:30, we'll place some nets, I think.  If you've seen the first talk today at the Side Track, the same people here, and it should be really fun.  And, of course, we have everything like Live JS and everything going on over at the party.  Thank you very much.
>>  Enjoy your dinner!
