>> Hi, welcome back everybody.  Hope you have been checking out the amazing things here at JSConf.  There has been some absolutely brilliant stuff out there.  This is the best conference I have been to, the food, there's yoghurt trucks, everything, I'm absolutely adoring it.  So we've got our next speaker coming up.  They've come all the way over from San Francisco.  I'm hoping they've got over the jet lag by now.  Their Twitter file introduced me to the word engi-queer which I'm loving and I am going to take as a job title from now, so please give a warm round of applause for Tilde Ann Thurium.
TILDE: Hi.  My name is Tilde, and I'm here to tell the story of how I built and shipped expanded gender options at Pinterest.  Some things I am going to cover are: why do expanded gender options in product matter; how we design the future and measure its effectiveness; and what I learned.  So gender forms.  Whenever I'm signing up for a new app or service, and I come across those not so fun radio buttons that only have male or female, I feel a lot of feelings.  Most of them are not good ones.
I have a lot of thoughts like: why?  Why are you asking me for this information?
There are a lot of reasons why genders get baked into product.  There are maybe medical reasons, there might be legal or compliance reasons, but mostly it's demographics or marketing, like ad targeting.  I'm not saying these are good reasons, I'm just saying this is why it happened.
When I first signed up for Pinterest, way before I started working there, I noticed those fun radio buttons that reinforced the gender binary and little did I know that I would soon be in a position to change that.  But how did I get there?  Software engineering is not my first career.  I have a degree in gender studies and then I spent about five years working  [sound problem] ... but then I got tired of working emotional labour on behalf of a major corporation so I quit my job, learned to code and got my very first engineer job at Pinterest.  I was shit terrified.  I had no idea what I was doing and basically was convinced I would be fired at any moment.  Somehow I managed to work through all that pain, confusion, fear and terror, and learned a bunch of stuff, and now it has been three years and I haven't been fired yet.  So yay!
Anyway, after I first got hired about a year passed and then I started to feel more confident, not just in my technical skills but in my inner personal understanding of politics that were going on around and above me and how people actually worked together to build and ship products.
Being the kind of stirring it up sort of person that I am, I started some conversations about the gender thing.  I wouldn't say those conversations were great, but neither were they awful.  People were like: yeah, I mean this isn't going to move our core metrics, we should just focus on things that are.
Now, don't get me wrong, I was never under the impression that expanded gender options are going to move core metrics.  That's not the point.  It's the kind of feature you build because it's the right thing to do if you want your product to be inclusive of everybody, so ...  [sound problem] ... if I wanted this feature to exist I was going to have to make it happen, and I was pretty sure I can figure it out.  Also I realised that I could leverage lack of co-ownership which was actually a big problem across the whole organisation - code ownership. I didn't have to ask permission because no one owned that code.  I could just build it.  Here are back end changes I made so before I started work on it we had this enum that represented gender.  Someone had run an AB experiment and discovered that if you don't force people to put in their gender, you get more signups.  Surprise, surprise.  So what I did, I added an optional string to the user struct to present a user's custom gender value.  It is my firm belief that gender should be represented by a string, not a binary value, so that way people could put in whatever they want, including an emoji.  What is the plural of emoji, is it emojis?  Emoji?  Anyway, emoji are getting more and more important because as technology becomes more ubiquitous, so does text-based communication and emoji are a great way of adding subtext to text.  Making emoji and hell all Unicode representative of the full spectrum of human diversity that exists is a little outside of the scope of my talk today but I will say that the emoji I am showing on screen don't officially exist yet.  Although I hope they do soon.  We are getting a non-binary emoji though in the 2017 spec which is pretty rad.  Anyway, let's talk about internationalisation and localisation and how they relate to gender.  People use these terms interchangeably but they are not exactly the same.  Localisation is a process of adapting your product, the text, the design, to work in one specific market, so this picture here is from the movie Inside Out.  In it, the protagonist, Reilly, she is a little girl and she just hates broccoli, except for in Japan where she hates green peppers, because green peppers are a vegetable that are more hated by children in Japan than broccoli.  Since Inside Out is a movie about feelings and empathy it was important to get the little details right so the movie would work cross-culturally.  So internationalisation is the more generally used case, like let's say you kept having this vegetable problem and you decided to build like a vegetable injector and ship it so that you could show users a different vegetable base somewhere in the world and that would be an example of internationalisation, kind of the tools and framework that enable you to localise in multiple languages.
A base use case for localisation, okay you have an English string and it represents some user face in copy.  The string has a placeholder value in it that represents the user name.  At run time we look up the user's language setting and then replace the string with the string in their language, and then also replace the placeholder value.  So if I'm a German user and my name is Tilde, hello user name becomes hello Tilde.  Why does this matter for expanded gender options?  Well, I'm not a linguist, so bear with me, but there's this concept of grammatical gender that about a quarter of the world's languages have.  Grammatically gender languages have - the nouns have genders and you have to match the other parts of speech in the sentence, like verbs and so forth, with the noun.  English is not grammatically gendered but it does still have gender baked into it in all kinds of little places like third person pronouns and titles, so when I first decided to build expanded gender options for Pinterest, I wanted to allow users to supply their preferred pronoun too.  It's more inclusive to not only allow people to say what their gender is but to specify how they would like to be referred to.  Unfortunately, that didn't really work out because the localisation provider that we were using didn't handle gender in placeholder strings so we had to kind of work around that.
On the plus side, the translation provider not using gender and placeholder strings meant that all of our user interface and copy was already gender neutral as it refers to users.  The writing team hates it because you end up with awkwardly worded sentences where you are avoiding pronouns but at the same time I did not have to do any extra work.  Oh.
This is awkward.  [Laughter]
Thank you.  I didn't have to do any extra work to make our text work for users who don't identify as male or female.  Who cares what the writing team thinks?  That's pretty cool.
So if you are not like Pinterest and you are not like locked into a contract with a certain localisation provider you have options.  I found a bunch of software packages that support localisation of gender and placeholder strings out of the box.  Caveat.  I have not used any of these personally, so if you have I would love to know what your experience is like.  Come find me after the talk or tweet at me or something.
But man, can we talk about pronouns for a second?  Pronouns are complicated.  I wanted to shout out for having the preferred gender pronoun buttons, that makes my heart warm, I hope every conference is doing that, but anyway a lot of people who don't identify as male or female use "they" as their preference but there are so many pronouns out there.  A website is trying to list all the different pronouns but how do these concepts translate cross-culturally and cross languages?  Some languages don't have gender pronouns at all.  Some languages like Farsi have pronouns for if an object is animate versus inanimate, for example.  So make sure your copy writers and translators are working with linguists who end the best gender preferences in that language.
So talked about the back end, talked about localisation stuff, then I did the front end or the middleware and API changes, blah blah blah, and then I made the front end changes.  The first thing I did was put user gender on the settings page.  Politically speaking, it's pretty easy to put user gender on the settings page.  It's like the junk draw of any application and no one gives a shit.
A funny thing happened after I did this though.  People, even though the conversation I had started earlier had been a little lukewarm, people came out of the woodwork to support me and they were like: oh, this is so cool, what can I do to help?  I was like: well, it sure would be great if we supported this feature on iOS and Android as well so I was able to help people make that happen.  It didn't solve the original problem though.  Users still had to put in their gender when they signed up for Pinterest and I wanted to fix that.
Unlike the - oh no - unlike the settings page the sign-up form is very political and people really care about every pixel on that page, and it impacts top line metrics, so I knew that we would need to take a more data-driven approach.  Here are a few design iterations we went through on the way to shipping expanded gender options on sign-up.  The first thing I tried was putting a simple radio button in.  When a user checks the radio button, another text box pops up where they can put in their gender value.  The problem with this is the sign-up code is used in many places, which is a good thing, right?  Don't repeat yourself.  But one of those places was this narrow little skinny little model, and when you internationalise text or when text is localised into longer languages such as French or German, you need to account for about 30% more room for that text.  So the text didn't fit in French and German in the skinny model.  They could have just made it wider but I didn't want this feature coupled with a certain specific design.  I wanted it to be more robust because I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time to maintain it.  I asked a design friend for his feedback or suggestions.  This is what he came up with.  There are a couple of problems with this.  Number one, there's no universal signal or no universal symbol that represents all users who don't identify as male or female.  Except maybe the Prince symbol.  [Laughter]
Number two, a lot of people just straight up can't remember which symbol means male and which symbol means female.  And number three, this is meant to get us around the localisation or the text length problem, but these symbols don't work all that well cross-culturally.  Not so fun fact: symbols of homosexuality are illegal in Russia and a symbol for non-binary people could fall into that category.  So really this just wasn't going to fly with anybody.
All right, fine, I will just do the hackie thing and move on with my life, but nope.  I was blocked.  The person who was responsible for the metrics of the sign-up form strongly felt like this was going to cause problems.  He was really worried that Pinterest made demographic of conservative mid-western moms would object.  For a little while the project stalled and I was frustrated.  I didn't know what to do and then in the way of tech companies, there is a re-org.  [Laughter]
Suddenly I was reporting to this person who had blocked me before, so my first line, I was like: look, if you want me to trust you and be on your team then you need to get me some face time with a designer who can help me get this form to meet your arbitrary standards.  And you know what, he came through for me.  It's a little bit of a tricky design problem, right, like how do you make a feature visible for the small minority of users who really care about it but not so visible that the majority who might not understand or be upset won't notice it and get pissed off?  This is what we came up with.
There's a little info icon.  When you hover over it we show a tool tip.  On the tool tip we explain why we want this information, which is kind of important, and then allow you to put in your custom gender string.  After a user clicks save, we replace male or female with the text that they typed in.  So we rolled this out as an AB experiment.  Unfortunately, signups were down about 1%.  Wamp-wamp, back to the drawing board.  I hypothesised that maybe users were unintentionally triggering the hover interaction, getting confused, so I said: let's make this a click interaction.  When we tried it with a click interaction, signups were flat, so we shipped it.  Yay!  [Applause]
Thank you, finally.  We also - I measured that people were actually using the custom gender part because, if signups were flat but if no one is actually using it, then what's the point, right?  But then we took things even a step further.  I was approached by a designer on the mobile team and she was like: hey, I'm re-doing the whole mobile sign-up flow and why is custom gender on web so hidden?  Can't we just put it in there with the other options?  And I was like: you are not going to get any argument from me about that.  This was wrapped in an AB experiment too, of course.  It's not exactly an apples to apples comparison because the new sign-up flow is visually very different but the metrics are better for it so that's what we went with.  Of course, quantitative metrics never tell the whole story so we did qualitative user research as well.  Sentiment towards custom gender options in this research was positive.  People said things like: custom gender is an awesome idea for our progressive social climate.  We got some love on social media as well.  But the whole process got me thinking, like why?  Why is this feature so important to me?  Why do I care so much?
Yes, so on this slide there's a movie which some of you have clearly seen called But I'm a Cheerleader and in this movie Megan, the main character, has a realisation that not everybody struggles with same sex attraction.  She is different, she is a lesbian.  Building this feature, I realised not everybody has - feels about it, having to put gender into their box.  But I do, I'm different, I am non-binary.  What does this mean for me?  Still figuring that out, TBH.
So just to recap, building this feature taught me that you can leverage the chaos that will inevitably be present in your organisation to advance your social justice warrior agenda.  [Laughter] [Applause]
After I got the ball rolling, people came out of the woodwork to help me.  Finally, the process of writing software, building stuff, getting it right, getting it wrong, can teach you about yourself in ways that you might not expect.  Thank you.  [Applause]
>> Wasn't that absolutely fantastic?  That one gave me so many feels right here in my heart organ.  It was absolutely amazing.
