Barriers to Entry in the JavaScript Community

      >> Hello.  All right.  Just a few people kind of dawdling in.  The next speaker, Khalid, is from the UK.  He's been working on a few startups.  He has an interesting story we're going to enjoy.  He has the red lanyard.  If you can respect that and not take photos or videos.  You can, of course, take them of the slides.  Yeah, so let's kick it off.
      >> Hi.  I'm Khalid.  My talk is about the barriers to entry in the JavaScript community and I'll be speaking from experience.
      JavaScript powers the web.  It runs on service.  We can use it to collect the Internet of Things.  And according to a former speaker at this conference, we can even use it to pilot helicopters.  This diverse use of the language excites and attracts a lot of new programmers.
      And we, as a community, need to sustain this interest for our own benefit.  JavaScript is really easy to get started.  We have lowered the barriers to entry when it comes to things like online resources and books.  But there's still a lot to be done to help all those who are looking to find a welcoming community.  If we really want to support new programmers from diverse backgrounds, we need to do more than just point them at the economy and say come back when you're ready.  We need to invite them into our community so they can connect with other programmers.
      Unfortunately, some people will find accessing our community easier than others.  As a programmer from a minority background, I want to illuminate some of the barriers that I faced.  The point of this talk is not to persuade you that we need more diversity.  That's an issue that's already been raised and answered.  I am not an expert on diversity in tech.  And I'm not here to speak on behalf of all minorities.
      Instead, I'm trying to provide an intimate lens into what it was like for me when I started out on my programming journey.  I'll talk about what did not work for me, what did, and then distill these points in two suggestions for what we, as a community, can all do to be more welcoming.
      My path to learning to program, perhaps, does not fit the typical expected narrative.  I grew up in a marginalized community in London.  A lot of people there lived in low income government housing and over 200 languages were spoken in my neighborhood.  I did a bunch of different things before starting a startup.  I was a solo, nontechnical founder.  And I could not build what my customers wanted.  This frustration gave me a way into programming.
      I started learning with what was most easily accessible.  JavaScript, Codeacademy, and from books.  As fortunate as I was to have these amazing resources, I could not see the link between what I was learning and making something useful.  And I needed to find people so they could help me figure this coding thing out and help me learn the things I know I was missing.
      So I excitedly went to my first JavaScript meetup.  I thought it would be this wonderful place where you can ask questions and get help.  As I entered the room, I became hyperaware of my status as a minority.  The room was not the melting pot of cultures I was used to from a city like London.  I felt as if there were invisible walls stopping me from really being part of the group.  People there appeared to already know each other and formed small groups.  I felt out of place.
      I was like a kid on a school playground that no one wanted on their team.  I tried to participate, but had to peek over the shoulder of people to see what was going on.  And I got the impression that asking questions would be making myself a nuisance to them.  My impression of the JavaScript community based on that meetup, I would probably not be here today giving a talk.  Some might say to this experience, learning to code is hard for everyone.  And people just have to work harder to succeed.  Why did you not do more to fit in?
      I think the situation is more complicated than that.  And I know what I was experiencing has a hot to do with a wellresearched psychological known at stereotype fate.  It's when they're in a situation where they feel at risk of conforming to a negative stereotype about their social group.  When this happens, people spend a lot of mental energy on avoiding to conform to a potential stereotype instead of performing well on something they care about.
      Members of groups, like AfricanAmericans in college and women in math and science, were shown to score much lower on tests when reminded beforehand of their race and gender.  And stereotype threat can be triggered by relatively small, unintentional environmental cues.  So being the only female at a meetup can interfere with performance.  I have been to programming events where people asked me, are you a programmer?  When asked this question over and over again, it can be hard to focus on programming.
      Facing and unwelcoming environments, whether unintentional or not, may scare people off initially.  Or ultimately prevent them from becoming a programmer.  Fortunately, I was confident that programming was for me.  I was discouraged, but undeterred.  I had to find it elsewhere.
      I managed to convince a friend of mine to help me out on the weekends.  I found another mentor through my contacts.  One day I learned about the selfdirected programming retreat in New York City called the Rica Center.  Formerly known as Hacker School.  I made a connection to someone from that community.  His name is Lev Berlin.  I had two mentors, but they had limited time.  One lived across the ocean in New York, and the other worked fulltime.
      I had to find more people.  As I was getting better, I was invited to apply to a JavaScript training program.  And this happened when I was attending a weekly meetup.  One day the founder came up to me and said, you're progressing really well in Node.  How come you're not applying to our program?  And out of desire to be a part of a community, I applied.
      About 24 hours later, I was rejected by that same founder.  If it's correct, students from that program told me over 80% of the cohort were Oxford and Cambridge graduates.  And people I personally knew from there appeared to be from a welloff, highlyprivileged background.  Both of these, while widely out of sync with the demographics of the neighborhood they were in, they were in this working class, multicultural area that was going through gentrification.
      I knew the course was not for me, but I could see a pattern where people support those who are most like them.  And then those support others who are most like them.  And so on.  It's like this selfperpetuating cycle that maintains its own homogeneity.  After not getting into the community and feeling out of place in other meetups, I had to seek alternative solutions.
      So I'll tell you how I overcame these barriers.  I needed a positive and inclusive community.  So I began to think more about the selfdirected programming retreat that one of my mentors told me about.  The more I learned about it, the more it seemed like the right fit for me.  So I went to the U.S. to find out more about it.
      I was based in New York City.  I coded in this library and random coffee shops.  I also went to workshops and meetups.  This time around, I had a much better experience.  The organizer of a meetup praised some code I wrote.  He told me, you're doing pretty advanced things for a beginner and then got me in to help someone else.
      In another workshop people said you came all the way from London, why don't you present?  I was hesitant, but then someone helped me do a short talk on ES6 modules.  I also met Nick, one of the cofounders of the Rica Center.  I told him about the frustrations that I had in finding the right programming community.  Nick then encouraged me to apply.
      Getting encouragement from many people I met boosted my confidence.  And after my brief stint in the U.S., I went back to the UK.  As I said earlier, I had two mentors.  My programmer friend and Lev from the Rica Center community.  Despite being in New York, he went out of his way to help me.  And at the time he and I had never met before.  Mentors helped me set up my coding environment, build things, debug, much more.
      And that gave me the motivation to program more.  Working with mentors helped me focus on problems instead of tools.  It was beautiful.  And I got a high from learning how things worked.  My mentor in London came to talk with me and lent me his privilege.  This made it easier for me to be accepted as a programmer.
      As I got better and more confident at programming, I applied to join the Rica Center community.  On the Website, it explicitly mentioned that university degrees or work experiences are not important.  Random pseudonyms like representative are used in the application instead of real names.  This helps take away unconscious bias when looking at applicants.  There were no tricks.  Everything was clear.  And this was the complete opposite experience to when I applied to the JavaScript program.
      During my interview, I pair programmed with Eric Weinstein who wrote the JavaScript tutorials for Codeacademy.  And after we finished I began my programming journey with his tutorials.  Eric then said, you have come full circle and put the circle in the air.  When I did that, I somehow knew I got in.
      Thankfully I soon got a confirmation email.  I packed my bags and flew back to New York to take part in the programming retreat.  My time at the Rica Center was easily one of my best educational experiences.  There were no set curriculums and no teachers.  I was free to explore whatever interested me in the world of programming.  The Rica Center has four lightweight social rules that are meant to create a productive and welcoming learning environment.
      Rule number one, no feigning surprise.  Do not accept surprise when people say they don't know something.  For example, someone might say, what the heck is web assembly anyway?  And someone else might reply, what?  I can't believe you don't know what web assembly is.  And rule number two, no, "well actuallies." A well actually happens when someone says something that is almost, but not 100% correct and then you say, well, actually, and then give a minor correction.
      This does not mean that truth is not important.  But a "Well, actually," is usually more about impressing others than truth seeking.
      Rule number three, no backseat driving.  Do not frequently lob advice across a space when you overhear people working on a problem.  This can be very distracting.  And rule number four, which is my favorite, no subtleisms.  This rule is different from the others in that it covers a broad range of subtle behaviors.
      When someone asked me at that programming function, are you a programmer, that is a subtleism.  Because it implies this fact, somehow strange.  And most of the barriers that I faced were of a very subtle nature.  No one told me, get out of here, you're not welcome.  I found these social rules very helpful at the Center.  Someone feigned surprise I was too slow on a terminal.  Another person made a subtleism comment.  I was able to call both of those people out and it was not a big deal.  They just apologized and we moved on.
      I was curious what others were working on, they offered me a seat rather than turning their backs or forcing me to watch over their shoulder.  I did not need to spend time and energy thinking about how I was portraying myself.  I did not need to spend my own mental, computational cycles managing stereotype threat.  I didn't know to spend time dealing with diversity fatigue.  It can be extremely frustrating to point out a problem and people say, well, what can we do about it?
      And even though it's done with good intentions, it pushes the problem right back on those most affected by it.  The Center is not perfect, but has a plan for when things go wrong.  There are facilitators who are paid to deal with these emotionally draining problems.  I am now a member of a community that has about a thousand smart and friendly programmers from around the world.
      Now, that you have heard my story, what can we do to make our community more welcoming and lower the barriers to entry for others?  I think we can be more like the Rica Center.
      The first thing we can do is provide more scholarships and sponsorships.  So people can go to workshops, conferences, and programming retreats.  One of the great things about the Center is they provide needbased grants for people from traditionally underrepresented groups in tech.  While the Center it free, living in New York is not.  And if you don't have a lot of money, but have some spare time, you can volunteer to mentor people, especially those from marginalized communities who might have less access to mentors.
      When I was using online resources and books, I could not build anything from scratch.  I was able to overcome that when I found people who were able to guide me.  And if you want to mentor, please, do not just focus on people who are like you.  Reach outside of your network.  There are many organizations like Code Bar, who run projects for marginalized people in tech.
      We can also use the lightweight social rules.  At the RICA Center, I know I get distracted by the feeling that I don't belong.  And these lightweight social rules have a lot to do with that.  If someone says you have done something to exclude them, there is no need to get defensive.  You simply apologize, no big deal.
      Anyone organizing meetups, workshops or conferences can explicitly mention that programmers of different experience levels and backgrounds are welcome.  And follow through their statement with actions.  When I went to the workshops in the U.S., this helped me did.  This helped me settle in quickly and helped asking questions easier.  And we can all do something simple like give encouragement.  This takes very little effort, but can have a huge impact.  Gives positive values that can reduce the harmful effects of stereotype threat.  On my programming journey, the encouragement I got from others helped me get through difficult times.
      We can also build empathy by signal boosting other people's stories.  Speaking of this, I want to thank the people that helped me with this talk.  The conference organizers, especially Simone and Phil leap, former creator, and many, many others.  It has been a rollercoaster ride, but I can now say I am a programmer.
      I'm thankful for all the ways that I pointed out that people included me and helped me and pushed many to succeed.  I'm very happy to be part of this community.  To be here.  Surrounded by so many smart and interesting programmers.  I enjoy programming and JavaScript.
      I wanted to share my personal story of lows and highs, because I know there's so many others out there who may be just stumbling upon Codecademy right as I speak.  I want to reach out and help them to be part of this community.  We need programmers, we need new ideas, we need new points of view to help this community grow and thrive.
      I hope everyone can take something from this talk.  Perhaps you can reach out to someone who may be working hard.  Perhaps harder than need be, to join us.  Next time you see a newcomer at a meetup or conference who appear to be lost, invite them in.  Ask them:  What is your story?  Thank you.
      [ Applause ]
      >> Wow.  That was fantastic.
      [ Applause ]
      I do believe Khalid is in the job market, so if anyone is looking for a programmer, we have a fantastic one.  And if you know anybody, exactly the same.  Again, a little break before the next period.  So  yeah.  If you want to change track, or come up and say hi, you should definitely do that.
      >> I have one more thing  hold, please.  One of you didn't listen to the initial announcement.  There was a request for no photos, please.  One of you posted a photo on Twitter.  Please delete immediately.  Thank you.
