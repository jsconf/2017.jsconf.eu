"Keep the Internet Weird"
Rachel White

>>  So this was our second-to-last talk for the day.  We have one more talk.  We're welcoming Rachel White up to the stage.  And she comes all the way from can anyone guess?  New York City -- whoo!  Yeah, so Rachel loves cats and fog machines I've been told.
    RACHEL:  Not together!
>>  Not together.  Okay.  She's not a monster.  So she is going to give a talk today about keeping the Internet weird.  I believe that references a time pre-Stack Overflow which kind of gives me eye twitches.  Are you already set up?  She's ready together.  Thank you very much, our last talk for the day, give up for Rachel.

    RACHEL:  Hello, everyone.  My talk today is called Keep the Internet Weird and you'll figure out why a little bit later on.  My name is Rachel White, I'm a self-taught developer, artist, technologist, creative, cyborg, ask me why later, techie evangelist at Microsoft, nice person and I'm also really bad an at descriptors talking about myself is weird.  I'm also @oho on Twitter if you're interested in more things that I have to say.
    So this is going to be my love letter to the Internet.  I'm going to tell you a story about the things that I've done, the people that I've met and the things that have led me to be here on this stage today.  We're going to start at the beginning.  This, right here, is the VTech Socrates and it came out in 1998 and it was technically my first computer.  And it was a video game device that was educational.  You were able to do math problems, interior design and just decorated houses which has forever ruined me from playing The Sims, it was my first tangible experience with connecting to technology and from then on, I was pretty much ruined.
    This thing, right here, is Are You Afraid of the Dark, it tail of Orpheus' curse, and was a tale adventure game that was released in 1994.  And this is, you're doing typical are you afraid of the dark stuff, like, searching for mummies, and I didn't have a computer, but I had friends who did, like, I was super hooked to anything that I could get my hands on.  And then I did got my own computer.  And if you know what this is, this is AOHell and it's a wares tool.  Now when I get a PC, I was like, now I have knowledge at my fingertips.  Unfortunately, my dad had AOL, so it was -- but once I got AOHell I was able to manipulate some of the code that was in the programs and do horrible things like post linguistics into chatrooms that if somebody clicked it, it would kick them off of their dial-up modem and then from there I went on to IRC, and this was when I first really started interacting with people.  And I chose this screenshot because it's the first way that I ever pirated things on the Internet.  These are XDCC bots if anybody remembers what those were.  Basically an album would be so large so you would have to send a message to a bot that had a bunch of compressed files that you would get it piece-by-piece so if your dial-up got disconnected because your sister picked up the phone or whatever, you would be able to pick it up and abstract it later.  So these were my first experiences communicating with Apple on the Internet.  Some of it is nice, some of it is illegal, but basically I was like, yeah, this is rad, I need to do more.  And then I discovered GeoCities and angel fire.  I made sights for Blink 182 because I was super obsessed with them and thought they were really cool.  And I also thought I was super punk so I had animated dolls and stuff.  And one of them was a site when I started learning how to program.  And I didn't start learning how to program because I love programming, and I'm going to go to school, and I want to make a lot of money.  I just did it out of necessity because I wanted my voice to be heard, and I wanted to be out there.  And then I found Web Rings.  So when I started thinking about my journey and connections with the Internet, I realize so much of it was the result of exploration and discovery and it was pretty much because I was not happy with the life that I had in rural Florida, the people that were around me, I didn't get along with.  They didn't have common interests?  But people on the Internet did and I could find anybody that was interested in any of the same things that I was.  And I could talk to them and we could exchange ideas and it was really inspiring.  It was a type of escapism that opened me up to new ideas.  And when I started making sites on GeoCities and AngelFire, I realized how fun it was to learn and share that information.  But then, through Web Rings in about earlyish 2000, I discovered personal sites.
    So I saw these networks of extremely well curated sites, impeccably designed with attention to detail, carefully written entries and crafted lists for other people to follow and check out.  And they weren't just sites like we have personal sites now.  I'm sure we all have personal sites.  We all have blogs.  This is pre-WordPress.  This is actually a software called Gray Matter which was in perl and just saved your entries locally.  But we were educating and helping each other share knowledge and I wasn't because they were trying to boost their ego about how much stuff they knew, or how many things they could, you know, share out there.  It was people who were self-taught and learning how their own design, learning how to do their own scrollable divs and their own link changes.  And it was mostly younger women.  And it was really cool.  And it was really welcoming that you could be able to find out how to, you know, size your font the best way so that eight pixels, or ten pixels looked the coolest.  You could learn how to use grunge brushes on Photoshop which were, like, the coolest things ever.  So I found all these other teenagers and I knew that I really wanted to be a part of it.
    So I still remember the first site that I came across when I was, like, cool, this is awesome.  I found this woman, her name is Melissa.  This is gleeb.com and she was the first person that I really found where I was, like, wow I really like her entries.  I really, really like the music she likes, all the things that are really cool.  Also, content warning, this is 2002, 2010, there might be some bad things in all of these entries that you will see, fair warning.  I didn't proofread.  I loved all the other sites that she hosted.  A host/hostee relationship is when someone has their own domain name and then they gave their space to other people, and you can share.  And usually it's people who would have similar interests and so I could go to all these other sites and find people like Melissa that I identified with, and I wanted to be like Mel, and I wanted to put my voice out there and so I did.  This is one of my very first personal sites.  My AIM name was BamAndPontiusChick because I really loved Jackass.  And I loved throwing things at crowd surfers and they would kick me in the head.  But this was the first place that I got to express myself and find other information and dive into Allyssa explains, and find all the HTML help they're wanted.  There was people who were willing to just help people out with their link buttons.  And I eventually grew out of having a hostee site and I wanted my own domain name.  So I got this one, well, these two.  I finally convinced my parents to let me have some hosting.  It was probably one and one, or GoDaddy or something like that.  And then finally I was on my way, I got obsessed with grunge brushes, as you can see and I had domain names where things I was inspired by my favorite lyrics.  So a lot of the domain names were like screamo, or punk band stuff, or that's unlike M-83 and they're not punk.  It's like the scrollable divs, and the stat counts, which was the pre-Twitter thing of how to count how popular you were.  And I was thinking the environment, and how good it felt to code through the process of discovery.  And asking questions was encouraged and people really loved to help.
    And I knew that I wasn't the only one.  So, of course, I do everyone does when they have an idea on the Internet, and I had decided to write a medium think piece on it.  And I was like, hey, friends, did you have personal domains, or were you writing HTML and CSS not for a job in the late '90s, early 2000s?  Talk to me about it!  And they totally did.  And I found a bunch of people had the same path as me, or a little bit different through Myspace, Neopets, CSS for Lifejournal, age he will fire, Geocities, other people who know the quality of a good paintbrush and put it was like, cool, all these people similar to me did the same thing.  I wonder if they learned the same thing.  So I asked, were you doing HTML/CSS/JS in the early 2000s?  Where did you get your coding info from online?  For me, it was Allyssa Explains and DynamicDrive.  And, again, the explanations were all over using CSS and a Zen Garden, Webmonkey, Allyssa explained, DynamicDrive, and View Sore, and it was still exploratory and fun.  And it made me realize that, obviously, when communities are nice, more people want to be a part of them and don't we all want our communities to be nice because we enjoy the things that we make, hopefully and we want other people to contribute to that, too?  I would like to think so.  Which then led me to think, when did communities stop being nice?
    And I found a certain trend in the areas that I thought it might have been.  And it was about 2007 and 2008 and it's something that happened, some websites that came out then.  It's the gameification of knowledge sharing.  And it sucks.
    Sure, it's helpful but people aren't necessarily being helpful because they care about you and they want to help you; they're helping you because they want points.  Arbitrary point out on the Internet.
    So I know that people make jQuery jokes a lot and there's nothing wrong with jQuery.  I've written a lot of it.  It's great for people that are learning but I think people that make these types of jokes, myself included directly because of the gameification of sharing.  We're asking for vanilla JavaScript answers and we're getting jQuery answers not because somebody cares about us, or wants to help us.  They just want to be heard.  And yeah, while the jQuery solves the problem, it doesn't solve my problem and while I think this is a problem, we can fix it.  What I want is more ideas and more people is more knowledge sharing.  So yeah, people are getting involved in communities means more knowledge sharing but when you add in the gamification, you're taking away the passion and I think that's pretty bad.
    We need more ideas and less echo chambers.  We need more people sharing ideas freely and encouraging code exploration and less gate-keepered echo chambers.  So now that we know why things could have maybe went so horrible.  Let's take a fun little stroll back between the Internet of then and the Internet of now.  So I'm going to give you some cool site how-toes for the early 2000s, starting with the coolest techniques, slices and tables.  Has anybody made a website like this?  Is anybody happy that they never had to do this again?
    So if you're not familiar, basically what you would do is your designer would lay out your design in Photoshop.  Responsive design didn't exist, to it didn't matter.  And then take this slice tool and draw out the sections that were important.  And you could even have a rollover for each of these sections.  Who needs CSS because we've got images and tables.  So there were a lot of sites that looked like this at the time.  And thanks goodness most of that is over.
    The other things that we did, which, obviously, this is my site with my cool haircut from 2003, lots of absolutely-positioned divs.  It didn't because, you know, we didn't care about responsive design then.  It wasn't really a thing.  So I could lay out this whole entire site and throw my grunge brushes all over it and say, okay, cool, I know where this scrollable div should go, and xy (0, 0) makes sense because who's going to maximize the div anyway?  And a lot of people making websites that were personal, spent a lot of time making really elaborate websites so you would still have that image techniques because obviously that font over on the left side isn't any kind of web font in 2003.  But it was popular.  But luckily today is better.  We have way more things.  We have way more things than back then with more people trying to get specs integrated into browsers.  So if you're starting out, you can start with things like CSS Grid, Flexbox, Tachyons, because it makes everything good without even having to try.  And Base CSS.  So now that we have the layouts covered, we're going to talk about some really cool fancy things.  Fancy things like DHTML.
    So the application of DHTML was actually introduced by Microsoft but I swear that's not like, hey, I work there.  It's just a thing.  And if you have heard the term static site before, a static site is being just HTML and CSS, you throw some JavaScript in there and it manipulates the DOM, guess what, you've got DHTML.  So difference basically a way for Microsoft with Internet Explorer 4 to be like, look how fancy this is, it's so cool!  So you could do fancy things like cursor effects.  So, so while you're mousing around on the browser, you have these plus signs, or ASCII characters, or bubbles, or stars, or whatever.  Because you're cool, and you want people visiting on your site.  But the cool thing is, this is still on DynamicDrive and so you can go back and look at the old code and I've put some new code over here.  You know, we're the last talk and I don't have all day to tell you about how we got cool star effects but I do have an extremely cool demo from 2003.  I gotta find which way the browser is.  Cool.  All right.  New York City no.  One sec.  Very busy so here's a really nice one in case you want to make a site about a celebrity that you have a crush on, and you want to let them how how much you want to kiss them.  You can put that cool kissing trail on there.  And here's another one, maybe it's winter and you want to celebrate the cold weather.  You're going to have maybe some snow falling and then, you know, maybe you are a really big fan of scuba diving and you want bubbles on your site.  So you can do this and more with DHTML and DynamicDrive which was all just copy and paste snippets and ridiculousness.  So you're in luck, too, because not only is today better for DHTML stuff, too, and we're going to talk about why, literally everything is better than what you were able to do in 2001 and JavaScript.  Everything that changes the DOM, 3JS is great.  P5, you can do VR in the browser now.  If you told me that in 2005, I would have been like, sure, okay.  You can even control hardware with JavaScript.  The limits are endless.  So while we've made so many steps with technology, we still have so much work to do.  The code is changed, but the people haven't.  For the most part, the ways that we communicate has changed and we have a lot of work to do to fix the damage that the gamification of knowledge has shaped some of our dev communities.  There's still the good people who are trying to help out and create a good community.  So support your communities.  Your local communities, global communities, other communities that you're not part of, support them all.  When I started the journey of writing this talk from the Medium article, to being here on this stage today, I realized something, and that's that never in my life have I felt more supported than I did in the early 2000s as I do right now.
    So I went to JSConf 2014, as my first conference ever.  I didn't know who Tom Dale was, I didn't know who they were.  I was just pumped to be there and to learn and I kept to myself.  This was me lurking behind the dunk tank where I had dunked everyone.  And I learned so much, and, honestly, this conference changed my life.
    I met this friendly guy and I'm lucky enough to -- I'm going to get emotional.  He took the time to be nice to me.  And he told me about Brooklyn JS and when I got back to New York, I went and I met so many good people that were friendly to me, and nice to me and they were just like people that cared.  And they're people that put people before code.  And I think that's important.  They inspired me.  Whoa!  They inspired me and motivated me that I could do whatever I wanted as long as I just tried.  And that's really important.  And you can have that, too.
    If you don't have the communities available to you in your area, make them.  There are people out there that are willing to help make whatever you want to be a welcoming, and inclusive space.  Trust me.  Reach out to me.  Reach out to the organizers, they're willing to help.  They'll be more than happy to give that to you.
    And in case you don't know, here are some helpful communities.  There's WeAllJS which is a really fantastic organization that is JavaScript focused and it's inclusive to everyone and it's just really helpful and nice, and they have a Slack, and a Twitter, and they have conversations.  And then there's CodeNewbie, which is welcoming for everyone, every language.  They have chats every week to talk about what you're learning about programming.  And Chiron just had their first conference which was called Codelands and it was the most inclusive event that I've ever been to in my life and they were applauding people as they were leaving and it made me feel good about development.  And there's also First PR, and that's made with Charlotte and it's encouraging organizations to encourage tagging on issue cues for things that people might be able to help out with, and then there's NodeTogether which Ashley Williams have started which has taught people from under-represented minorities, to learn how to program all over the world and I'm lucky that she was able to take control of it, and be able to do that.  So I guess the whole point of keep the Internet weird to me is don't stifle creativity.  Code exploration is important.  Not being afraid of trying new things is extremely important.  We need to foster growth in our communities instead of making people be afraid to be a part of them.  We need to have people try new things because they want to try them.  And I have this stickers so if you want them, keep bother me later.  I have a lot of them.  I actually commissioned these from an amazing designer called Skull Face because I wanted some really cool slides and stickers for you.
    So in case you want to talk to me after this, I'm @oho on Twitter, and my GitHub where I open source everything that I could possibly be able to open source and comment it if I can is there.  And then my extremely narcissistic domain name, Rachelisawesome, and I'm cool online.  Thank you.  And please keep the Internet weird.
