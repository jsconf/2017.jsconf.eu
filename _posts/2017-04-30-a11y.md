We do our best to ensure that the conference, venue and events throughout the day are fully accessible, so that all attendees can wholly participate in and enjoy the conference. To do this, we work closely with venue and volunteer staff prior to and on the day of the event to ensure disability access to all areas.

### Real-time transcription (CART)

As part of our [commitment to accessibility](/accessibility/), weâ€™re providing real-time transcription (CART) at JSConf EU. There will be a live feed of every word of each talk. Transcription will be available through in-venue screens and via these URLs: [Back track](https://www.streamtext.net/player?event=JSConfEU1), [Side track](https://www.streamtext.net/player?event=JSConfEU2).
