We are striving for the most diverse group of people possible — **we firmly believe in equality**, thus we invite everyone and anyone to participate. In order to make this possible, we are proud to announce our scholarship programme for people who would otherwise be unable to participate.

Our scholarship fund will support about **sixty people** to attend [JSConf EU](http://2017.jsconf.eu/) and/or [CSSconf EU](http://2017.cssconf.eu/). Scholarships include a free ticket to the conference that will be awarded after an application process and lottery. Depending on the funds we can raise, we plan to also fully sponsor travel expenses and accommodation, if required.

Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for this scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.

The application process is simple: Tell us about what you do with JS or CSS, and why you want to attend JSConf EU or CSSconf EU.

Scholarships are made possible by a joint effort of JSConf EU and CSSconf EU attendees and sponsors. Our attendees have raised over 40,000 EUR for scholarship tickets to the conferences in 2015. We are very proud to be part of this community for showing their support of this initiative. **Thank you!**

And let’s do it again! You help is needed again this year. Talk to us if you’d like to get involved: <a href="mailto:contact@jsconf.eu">contact@jsconf.eu</a>.
