Weâ€™re happy to be able to offer free, all-day childcare at the venue for children aged 3 and above. For parents with younger infants, we will provide a quiet room equipped with comfy seats, diapers and other essentials where you can retreat to throughout the day.

### Details

Between 9am and 7pm, there will be a dedicated area with childcare professionals who will look after your children while you enjoy the conference.

In order to use our child care services, we ask that you register a separate, free ticket below and let us know everything that is important to keep your child happy during the conference. Please note that places are limited and available on a first-come-first-serve basis.
