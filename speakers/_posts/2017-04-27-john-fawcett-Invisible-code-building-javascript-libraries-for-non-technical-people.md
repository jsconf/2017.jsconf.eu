description: "The vast majority of website owners (and therefore JavaScript users) are non-technical. They donâ€™t know how to copy-paste an embed code, much less how to use ES7 or React. But these website owners have a right to the same high quality tools we use every day. \n\nBy building tools which can be dropped into pages, which learn their configuration from their environment, which assume reasonable defaults and deliver value without having to be told how, we can make what we build work for everyone, not just the lovely people in this room.
