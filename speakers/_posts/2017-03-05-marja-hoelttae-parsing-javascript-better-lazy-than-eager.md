  Parsing JavaScript fast is critical for fast web page startup. We’ll look at
  challenges posed by complex frameworks and new language features and how V8,
  the JavaScript engine behind Google Chrome, solves them. You’ll learn how to
  write and bundle your code in a way that is fast to parse.



  Some topics I’ll cover in the talk:

  - How does V8 parse JavaScript and how does it decide what parts to parse
  / compile upfront?

  - Recent and upcoming improvements in the area of parsing JavaScript better

  - What should developers do to make parsing be less of a bottleneck?

  - Why is benchmarking parsing hard?
